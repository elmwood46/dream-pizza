# dream-pizza

Language: Visual Basic
Using SQL and Microsoft Access databases. 
Program created for my 2017 DGT class. 

The goal of this project was to create an ordering system for the hypothetical company "Dream Pizza". 
This system is meant to be used by the workers at the company. 

There were a number of requirements, including: 
- Employees able to search, view and add member details from a local database.
- Employees able to create a customer's order by choosing the customer (from the database), and choosing what pizzas they ordered (pizza types also stored in a database.) The program then calculates the cost, based on whether the order was takeaway or not, and whether the customer had a "premium" or "basic" membership with the company (or no membership at all.) Customers with membership get discounts. 
- The Dream Pizza logo must appear at the top of every form. 
- When the order is completed, employees must be able to print the receipt.
