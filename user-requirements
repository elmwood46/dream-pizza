Dream Pizzas is a local pizzeria that is trying to provide customers with cheap and delicious gourmet pizzas by 
offering membership discounts. The company is trying a modern attempt at business by offering discounts to members. 
The owners want to computerise phone orders to help reduce costs and provide better services. 
Specifically, they want to be able to enter orders into a Windows desktop and print receipts that will accompany the 
pizzas for both pickups and deliveries. A logo should be found at the top of any forms displayed in the program.

An employee should be able to search, view, and add member details to the order form from a local database. 
Non-members may also order pizzas. The order form should contain the type of pizza(s) ordered, how many of each pizza, 
the sub total of each pizza type, as well as the total amount due. The order should also say if it is takeout or delivery. 
If it is takeaway, no charge is added for non-members, a 5% discount is given for basic members and a 15% discount of total 
price for premium members. If it is delivery, a $5 charge is added for non-members, no charge is added for basic members and a 
10% discount of total price for premium members. Finally, the form should also show the name, address, and phone number of the 
customer. When the order is completed, the program should print a receipt that displays the data from the order form.
GST is 15%.

You are also required to design and create a database for Dream Pizza. 
The database will be used to store information about members and Pizzas.

The database will contain the following information:
Member info:
	number (a unique five digit number â€“ i.e. 12345, 35149, etc.)
	title. first name and last name
	address and phone number
	membership type and any delivery instructions
Pizza types
	The type of pizza along with cost for a small and large piece
